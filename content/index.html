      <h2>Why Am I Doing This?</h2>
      <p>This is my studying project. Boy, it's sure helping me remember some
        HTML and CSS/LESS.</p>
      <p>I hope to use this site to keep track of my notes, and progression through
      Lambda School.  I also wanted an excuse to use that fancy Sans Forgetica
    font. Hopefully, this will be a worthwhile endeavor, and <strong>won't end
      up being a timesink.</strong></p>
      <p>After a few hours working on this, I am reminded that most things worth
        doing take lots of hard work.  My Lambda brainload, will only be increasing,
        so best to just start building things now, so it doesn't hurt as bad then.
